Use this checklist as a phase tracker. Update each item explicitly.

Legend:

- `[ ]` not started
- `[-]` in progress
- `[x]` done

## Intake

- [ ] missing `polycpp` primitives listed

## API Mapping

- [ ] major public `v0` APIs mapped
- [ ] direct vs adapted vs deferred status recorded
- [ ] dynamic typing adaptations recorded

## Testing

- [ ] `docs/divergences.md` is no longer placeholder-only
- [ ] `docs/test-plan.md` is no longer placeholder-only
- [ ] strict readiness passed

## Implementation

- [ ] implementation started after strict readiness
- [ ] tests added as features are implemented
- [ ] new divergences documented immediately

## Validation

- [ ] targeted tests pass
- [ ] README examples match actual code
- [ ] remaining gaps are documented

## Public Release
