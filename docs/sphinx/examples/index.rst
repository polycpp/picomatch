Examples
========

Self-contained programs exercising the main features of picomatch. Each
released example must compile against the public API only - no private
headers, no non-exported targets.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   planned

Running an example
------------------

From the repository root:

.. code-block:: bash

   cmake -B build -G Ninja
   cmake --build build --target <example_name>
   ./build/examples/<example_name>

Examples are only built when ``POLYCPP_PICOMATCH_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON`` is passed to CMake.
